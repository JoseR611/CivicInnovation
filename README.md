For the city of Buffalo, We have come up with the idea of a Parking App. An App that detects the user gps location and if the location is at a place where there are most tickets received, it will notify the user, and also suggest the user the nearest available parking spot (which could be a parking meter near by, or a parking on the street). Our app will also be notifing the user if the meter timing expires so that "METER OVERTIME" tickets can be successfully avoided. 

We have used a sample data across Forest Avenue and Elmwood Avenue and W delaware Ave and Delaware Ave. 

This app will majorly help the citizens and tourists to save time, as according to the news at an average 17hrs a year sesarching for parking and top of it the cost, at an average a driver spends $97 per year on parking tickets. Given the fuel consumption by a vehicle during the time a driver finds a parking spot, out application will not only be helpful to the city of Buffalo but to the entire United States of America. 

Our app is still in the developement stage and We are working towards collecting more data from the streets of the City of Buffalo. As we have seen that there a lot of streets where there is no parking rules dictacted but we can see one or two cars parked still. We can use such spaces to tell the driver to park his car if there is no available meters or spots. We are also trying to build up the feature where a driver selects a destination and he/she gets details of all the areas with most tickets and possible places to park. 

We have a prototype of the app design, the video of the app can be found at https://youtu.be/wvx0ztoeLXs.
